# Understanding keyed collections
Keyed collections are data collections that are ordered by key not index
there are 2 tyoes if keyed collections:
- Map object
- set object

## Map object

Map is similar to a dictionary in c#, you insert key value pairs and can iterate through them via insertion order.

### Map methods

|Method|What does it do|
|---|---|
|.set(key,value)|Inserts the key value pair into the map object|
|.get(key)|Gets the value associated with the key|
|.has(key)|Checks if the map object contains that key, will output true/false|
|.delete(key)|deletes the key value pair associated with that key|
